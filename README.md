# Learning React.js with Flux [Video]
This is the code repository for [Learning React.js with Flux [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learning-reactjs-flux-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787284449), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Flux is a web application development architecture created and used by Facebook. It fits seamlessly with React—in MVC terms, Flux is the Model and Controller to React’s View, but it actually goes much deeper than that. Flux is a new way of thinking compared to the old MVC model. Instead, it sets out a Dispatcher, Store, and View model for creating applications with much clearer data flow. Enabling you to create cleaner and more easily maintainable applications that scale better and are easier to debug. 
This course starts by having a running server that connects to Mongo database with Mongoose. We will also explore more about Nodemon, express, EJS, MongoDB, and Mongoose. Then we proceed to add React to present the data sent from the server. After integrating React into our workflow, the course focuses on building some of the critical components required to create the To-Do list. Then we proceed to learn about data storage and management on the client. Once you get acquainted with Flux and React, finally, the course takes us through integrating the Flux application with our backend.
This course is a complete introduction to Flux, covering the new Flux paradigm and teaching how to create Flux and React web applications from the ground up.
